RGOS -- A hopefully straightforward OS design.
==============================================

Author: C. Forbes [chrisf@ijw.co.nz]


How to make it work:

	Assuming Ubuntu Lucid x86 on your host, you will need:
		* Oracle Virtualbox 3.2.0+
		* Packages: build_essential, nasm, genisoimage, grub, 
			git-core
		
	Checkout the sources:
		
		$ git clone git://github.com/chrisforbes/rgos
	
	Build it:
	
		$ cd rgos
		$ make
	
	Mount `rgos.iso` (in a VM, probably). Give it >= 64M of RAM, 
	and watch it work.
